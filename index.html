          <p>Overall I can say that I like the app. It looks nice, it has a very intuitive(at least for me) navigation system, it is informative and easy.</p>
          <p>Although, I am not sure so far if is going to actually help me to learn the language i need.</p>
          <p>It feels like it does too much guiding and a lot of the stuff I don't know where to look up in case i need it. Of course you can goggle everything but still.</p>
          <p>I am stil not done and have clearly learnt a lot but we will see at the end if it has any significant impact or if it is just a very nice way to start and I'll have to look for other sources.</p>

          <p> If somebody would have to tell me a week ago that I would be able to make a website I would tell them they it would be a lame one :D</p>
          <p> Just a few days later I came across <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> and started to create a blog. </p>
